### Wealthy people **hide** some of their money. <a id="wealthy-people-hide-some-of-their-money"></a>

They keep it in a place where even they themselves can't use it easily. This is their **savings account.**

### A savings account will **free you from worry**. <a id="a-savings-account-will-free-you-from-worry"></a>

A savings account is not for buying things, making money, or looking rich. **It is for emergencies only.** It's for when your phone gets stolen, when you lose your job, or when a family member dies.

## _**How much should you save?**_ <a id="how-much-should-you-save"></a>

Typically, a savings account has **enough money to cover these emergencies**:

1. Six months of expenses in case you can't work \(to pay for rent, food, phone bill, insurance, etc.\)
2. A family emergency \(to pay for travel and the funeral\)
3. A medical emergency \(to pay the doctor and to buy the drugs\)
4. The unexpected \(to cover anything from floods, fires, theft, etc.\)

## _**How much should Tyler save?**_ <a id="how-much-should-tyler-save"></a>

Tyler knows he needs to have enough money for **\(1\) half a year of expenses, \(2\) a family emergency, \(3\) a medical emergency and \(4\) the unexpected.**

Buying a new phone, computer and desk would cost Tyler $3,000 \(4\). If some family member were to pass away, he would need to spend $3,000 travelling and helping with the funeral \(2\). Tyler has insurance, but an injury could still cost him $6,000 \(3\) and he knows that his life costs about $12,000 every six months \(1\).

`3,000 + 3,000 + 6,000 + 12,000 = 24,000`

## _**How will Tyler save that much?**_ <a id="how-will-tyler-save-that-much"></a>

Because Tyler has never saved before, he is **starting with $0 in his savings account**.

Every year, his **expendable income** is $22,000.

It is possible to reach his goal in one year.

#### If Tyler saves $1,850 every month, **he will be worry-free in 12 months.** <a id="if-tyler-saves-1850-every-month-he-will-be-worry-free-in-12-months"></a>
