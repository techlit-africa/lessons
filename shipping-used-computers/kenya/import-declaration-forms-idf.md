# Import Declaration Forms \(IDF\)

An IDF must be applied for and obtained from the Kenya Revenue Authority for any Commercial Importation. The Importer is responsible for applying for the IDF but may use a clearing and forwarding agent to consult or input this into the ORBUS system. Once the IDF is passed, the importer might proceed to arrange inspection of the cargo \(see 1.2\) and once completed \(or not required\) ship the cargo. 

The IDF contains key information: 

**Value of the cargo for tax calculation.** 

> Note that values may be disputed by customs and cargo verified to solve any disputes over the same. It is strongly advised to use correct values.

**Quantity.** 

> Should be as detailed and correct as possible. Every slightly different type of goods should have their own specified quantity rather than grouping similar items.

**Quality.** 

> This should also be backed up by the inspection. Other control bodies such the Kenya Bureau of Standards, Public Health Department, Department of Agriculture \(Kephis\) etc. may be asked to determine if the expected standards have been met. Incase of suspicion, Tests may be carried out and Certificates/Permits issued. Under this criteria, test Certificates from accredited bodies may be required.

**Classification \(HS Code\):** 

> Just like the other items these might be queried so it is best to ask beforehand if not sure especially if different HS codes attract different taxations.
