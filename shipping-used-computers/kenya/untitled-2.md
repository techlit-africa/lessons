# Master Bill of Lading

When issuing the bill of lading, the shipping line should take care of the following guidelines: 

Consignee. The consignee column on the BL should read _**"Name & Full address of actual receiver".**_

This is carried over into the customs system and identifies the taxpayer \(or the exempted party\). This company / person must always be located in the country of destination and be tax registered \(have a PIN/TIN\).

Example: Even if for cargo going to Uganda, the buyer is the head office, located in Kenya, the cargo must be consigned to a registered company/person in Uganda.

Exceptions are in the case of letters of credit where a bank is consigned.

An alternative for shipments through Mombasa port is to describe the consignee as **“Aeromarine Capital as agents of Name & Full address of actual receiver “**.

This way will circumvent the need of endorsements by consignee at the back of the Bill of Lading. In general and definitely for cargo consigned to individuals rather than companies, we recommend the first option. 

Notify. The notify party on the BL should read: 

“SAME AS CONSIGNEE”.

**Place of delivery.** The place of delivery on the MBL should only be filled in case of Through Bill of Lading.

**Description.** The description of cargo on the BL should always mention the actual number of packages involved eg the BL should read "1x 40' STC 456 packages &lt;cargo type&gt; General descriptions like 1 x 40' STC Tiles, Pumps and spare parts should be avoided. This will necessitate the time wasting requisite of applying for manifest amendments to insert number of packages, which will lead to delay charges and demurrage. The number of packages mentioned on the BL should be the number of packages on the presented commercial invoice and packing list \(everything should tally\).

World IMCO standards apply at the Kenya Ports Authority. Thus if a shipment is classified under an IMCO class that falls into the category of Dangerous Cargo, cargo must be properly described as such with the correct code. Also note a surcharge is charged by the Ports Authority as soon the shipment is discharged from vessel. Importers are thus urged to familiarize themselves with these regulations and know that when shipping such kind of shipment.

**Telex Release.**

When organizing for a telex release \(as opposed to courier of Original BL\), the wordings of the release instructions should read "RELEASE CARGO TO AEROMARINE CAPITAL AS AGENTS OF "IMPORTERS /CONSIGNEES' NAME' WITHOUT PRESENTATION OF ORIGINAL MASTER BILL OF LADING".

**Container Freight Station Consigning.**

All containerized local imports into Kenya are normally transferred to a private CFS \(container freight station\) assigned on a per vessel basis by the ports authorities. This is to decongest the port. Exceptions are dangerous cargo and consignments whereby the importer has obtained special permission for port clearance. In order to obtain more free days for clearance of goods \(15-21 instead of the usual 4 days only\) an importer can nominate the Container Freight Station of his/her choice rather than having the cargo transferred to the Container Freight Station assigned to that vessel. It can also assist the importer in smoother delivery from the Container Freight Station if dealing with a better equipped Container Freight Station. For this to take effect, a clause “to be transferred to &lt;name&gt; CFS \(Container Freight Station\) on merchant’s account and risk” has to be inserted into the bill of lading. It has to be noted the Container Freight Station will charge an additional transfer fee in this case in return for the priority handling of the cargo and additional free storage days.chevron\_leftchevron\_right
