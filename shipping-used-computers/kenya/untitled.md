# Commercial Invoice

Invoice must be detailed \(as per pertaining packing list\) and the total CIF value of the consignment must be indicated. It would be preferable to have the exact details reflected on the packing list copied and paste on the commercial invoice and values indicated in the adjacent column, and a total CIF value indicated at the bottom of the document \(Items cost, freight charges and insurance amount must be duly broken down on each Commercial Invoice\).
