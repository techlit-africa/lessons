# Exemption Letter\(if applicable\)

Charities, major projects, governmental organizations, diplomatic missions, returning residents etc. can apply for exemption of duties and/or VAT. This is done by the receiver writing to the Treasury. If accepted, the Treasury instructs the customs not to collect the waived portion on the particular consignment. Exemption letters are usually granted for specific consignments which have to be exactly described in the application.

Obtained exemptions are uploaded into the customs system by means of a code which has to be passed on to the clearing agent when declaring the cargo later on \(see point 2.1 below\)
